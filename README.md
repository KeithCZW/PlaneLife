Motivation:

Remember the good old days? When we played arcade plane shooter games in the arcades? We do! So we wanted to make a game just like that so that we can relive the times when we played those very games! We wanted to challenge ourselves and make a game similar to the arcade shooters we used to play so much. We wanted to learn the new technology involved in creating games as well.
